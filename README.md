Computer science project - It System for a chocolate factory 

This is a school project created by me and three other students on 2 semester at UCN Computer science. The main goal of the project was to get in touch with a company and make a it-system for them. 
The semesters learning outcomes have been to make a database using SQL mananger and then make the database and the it-system share info between them.
